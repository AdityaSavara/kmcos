Modelling Workflows
===================

At the core of modelling lies the art to capture
the most important features of a system and leave
all others out. kmos is designed around the fact
that modelling is an experimental and creative process.

A typical type of approach for modelling could be::

  #. start with educated guess
  #. calculate outcome
  #. compare various observables and qualitative
     behavior with reference system
  #. adapt model, goto 1 or publish model

So while this procedure is quite generic it may help
to illustrate that the chances to find and capture
the relevant features of a system are enhanced
if the trial/learn loop is as short as possible.
