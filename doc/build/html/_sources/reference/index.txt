kmcos kMC project DTD
====================

The central storage and exchange format is XML. XML was chosen over
JSON, pickle or alike because it still seems as the most flexible
and universal format with good methods to define the overall
structure of the data.

One way to define an XML format is by using a document type description
(DTD) and in fact at every import a kmcos file is validated against
the DTD below.

.. literalinclude:: kmc_project_v0.2.dtd


Backend
========

In general the backend includes all functions that are implemented in Fortran90,
which therefore should not have to be changed by hand often. The backend is
divided into three modules, which import each other in the following way ::

  base <- lattice <- proclist

The key for this division is reusability of the code. The `base` module
implement all aspects of the kMC code, which do not depend on the described
model. Thus it "never" has to change. The `latttice` module basically
repeats all methods of the `base` model in terms of lattice coordinates.
Thus the `lattice` module only changes, when the geometry of the model
changes, *e.g.* when you add or delete sites.
The `proclist` module implements the process list, that is the species
or states each site can have and the elementary steps. Typically that
changes most often while developing a model.

The rate constants and physical parameters of the system are not implemented
in the backend at all, since in the physical sense they are too high-level
to justify encoding and compilation at the Fortran level and so they
are typical read and parsed from a python script.


The `kmcos.run.KMC_Model` class implements a convenient interface for most of
these functions, however all public methods (in Fortran called subroutines)
and variables can also be accessed directly like so ::

  from kmcos.run import KMC_Model
  model = KMC_Model(print_rates=False, banner=False)
  model.base.<TAB>
  model.lattice.<TAB>
  model.proclist.<TAB>

which works best in conjunction with `ipython <ipython.org>`_.
