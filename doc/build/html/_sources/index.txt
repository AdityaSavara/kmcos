  Things you can do with kmcos.


kmcos is a vigorous attempt to make (lattice) kMC modelling more accessible.


kmcos is designed for and by kMC model developers. As of this writing there
is no standardized way to develop kMC models, thus there is no standardized
way to use kmcos. kmcos can be an Editor, an API, a viewer. However all in all
kmcos wants to save time filled with repetitive labor and enlarge your stride.
