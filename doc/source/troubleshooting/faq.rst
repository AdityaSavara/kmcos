What other kMC codes are there?
  Kinetic Monte Carlo codes that I am currently aware of,
  that are in some form released on the intertubes are
  with no claim of completeness :

  - `akmc <http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/eon/akmc.html>`_ (G. Henkelman)
  - `Carlos <http://www.win.tue.nl/~johanl/projects/Carlos/>`_ (J. Lukkien)
  - `chimp <http://www.koders.com/cpp/fid7FA324E3E76DB9874158BE3CF722405FA44AECE8.aspx?s=mdef%3Ainsert>`_ (D. Dooling)
  - `KMCLib <https://github.com/leetmaa/KMCLib>`_ (M. Leetma)
  - `Graph Theoretical KMC Code <http://dion.che.udel.edu/downloads/>`_ (D. Vlachos)
  - `Monty <http://www.vsc.science.ru.nl/deij/monty.html>`_ (SXM Boerrrigter)
  - `MoCKa <http://www.itcp.kit.edu/deutschmann/288.php>`_ (L. Kunz)
  - `NASCAM <https://www.unamur.be/sciences/physique/pmr/telechargement/logiciels/nascam>`_ (S. Lucas)

  - `Zacros <http://zacros.org/>`_ (M. Stamatakis)

What is the relation between kmcos and kmos?
  Initially, the code was named kmos for
  `kinetic modeling on steroids`. However, during the 2020 revitalization and migration to python3, the code's name was changed kmcos with intention of greater emphasis of the generality of the code.
