Functionality
  * name import_file/import_xml_file consistently
  * reimplement 'print output' function using old_src
  * add various tooltips and examples using Claudias suggestions
   write autocompletion for output fields
  * write consistency check function that runs before
    exporting f90 source could and give the user hints
    about inconsistencies in the project
  * add undo function to process editor
  * improve layer editor: make handling better (removing/cancelling sites)
    and make better guess for z-position of site


Project related
  * configure pip mechanism
  * build virtualenv test environment(s): 2.4-3.0
  * build deb package


Future/optional projects:
  * Allow for non-orthogonal unit cells
  * do 2D version of process editor using ASE
    facilities first: basically rid gtkcanvas 
    in favor or pygoocanvas and include atoms
    in background
  * check-out blender and mayb additional 3D programs
    for good gui design of placing sites or species
    in 3D space


Defered:
  * build-up library of lattices which can be
    simply chosen from (making new lattice is very easy
    and fast)

BUGS:
  * fix output of observables
