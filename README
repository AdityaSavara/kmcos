DEPENDENCIES:
  In general this script has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 9.04-10.04 in conjunction with both gfortran and ifort. So things will most likely work best under a similar setup. Other than standard libraries you need to fetch
  python-numpy : contains f2py
  python-lxml: project files are stored as XML
  python-gtk: GUI toolkit
  python-kiwi, gazpacho: frameworks for python-gtk

  For questions and comment please drop me a line (anytime). Especially you get get import error, I most likely forgot a dependency. Currently this
  program still has a ton of rough edges. So please regard it at best as a useful proof of concept. Any input is welcome.

USAGE:
  Start the main program with 
    python main.py
  and create your model. To test it you need to press 'Export source' choose a folder where the source code will be dumped. Use a
  terminal to go to that directory and run ./compile_for_f2py. If this finishes without complains you can try running ./run_kmc.py.
  Output goes to traj.dat, parameters can be changed via param.cfg
