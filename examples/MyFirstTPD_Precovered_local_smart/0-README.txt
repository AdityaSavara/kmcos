In KMC TPD/TPR, there can be big problems if the temperature is started too low or if the simulation is allowed to run past all of the molecules desorbing.  For runfile 1 and runfile 2, we simply use 300K to 325K as a temperature range that we know will work without any issues for the particular number of sites and activation energy used in those examples. Some of the other TPD/TPR examples have more complex algorithms.

runfile 1 is using the snasphots module.
runfile 2 and runfile 3 are using the snapshots module and export import to show how to stop a simulation partway and continue it along the exact same trajectory as runfile 1.  Runfile 2 exports and stops once the temperature is above 310K and then continues.  It is important to recognize that "T" after "T_incr" is the temperature at the end of a snapshot, and serves as the temperature for the beginning of the next snapshot.
Runfile 4 uses save, load, restart in a single runfile, and was used as a check when making runfile 2+3.
