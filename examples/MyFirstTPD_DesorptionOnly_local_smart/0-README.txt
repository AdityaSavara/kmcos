Runfile 3 has an advanced algorithm that solves this problem.
runfile 3 is showing a more complex TPR API that will be incorporated 'directly' into kmcos but has not been yet. (Though when it is incorporated, the resets will require PRNG resets also).


For the runfile3 TPD example, the activation energy is typical for an adsorbate desorbing. 

You should use these settings:
Starting temperature = 200 
Final temperature = 700
Max steps: 30
Min steps: 10
