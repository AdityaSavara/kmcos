python "test_cli_generation.py" runs

inside \ini_test\
mini_101 ini test from quickstart works, but other ini tests in the ini test directory do not.

inside \complex render test\ does not work. seems like a relatively similar error.

omsode \test_acf\ is now partially fixed. test_1.py and test_2.py both pass. test_3.py gives "Segmentation Fault (Core Dumped)" yet running acf_test_function.py (which basically runs all three tests in a single loop) passes. I don't understand the reason. It could mean that acf is not yet working correctly with the otf backend. However, a reasonable trajectory is produced by acf_test_function.py, so it seems like acf might actually be working with the otf backend.

inside \export_test\test_build_run.py runs but test_import_export.py does not

inside \test_cli_generated_model\   no python file, but typing "kmos benchmark" does not work. Says no model dimension.

inside \test_run\  --> upgraded to UnitTesterSG. Now test_1.py and test_2.py both pass. test_3.py fails, does not create the final ".so" file, and displays an error that can be traced, so it seems the otf backend is not completely working yet. However, running test_3.py provides an opportunity to debug the otf backend creation.

inside \test_types\  test_coordinates_list.py  and  test_xml_ini_conversion.py  both run and pass (the 2nd one has 2 tests in it)

inside \MyFirstThrottling\ is a throttling unit test example

inside \SQERTSS_unit_tests\ are some SQERTSS (throttling) unit tests
